## Problem 1

### Read and clean data

The code below reads and cleans the data.

``` r
transit_data = read_csv("data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  select(2:5, starts_with("route"), entry, vending, entrance_type, ada_compliance = ada) %>% 
  mutate(
    entry = recode(entry,"YES"=TRUE,"NO"=FALSE),
  )
```

    ## Rows: 1868 Columns: 32
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## chr (22): Division, Line, Station Name, Route1, Route2, Route3, Route4, Rout...
    ## dbl  (8): Station Latitude, Station Longitude, Route8, Route9, Route10, Rout...
    ## lgl  (2): ADA, Free Crossover
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

- Cleaning steps

After loading the data, I clean the variables’ names using
`janitor::clean_names()` and select the required variables for a new
dataset `transit_data`, including `line`, `station_name`,
`station_latitude`, `station_longitude`, `route1-11`, `entry`,
`vending`, `entrance_type`, and `ada_compliance`. Next, I convert the
`entry` from character (`YES` & `NO`) to a logical variable (`TRUE` &
`FALSE`). The dimension of the resulting dataset is 1868 x 19.

These data are still not tidy enough from my perspective. First, the
route containing many missing values can be further cleaned.
Furthermore, the vending variable can be converted to logic variable and
there are repeated rows in the dataset.

``` r
dist_station = distinct(transit_data, line, station_name, .keep_all = T)
```

- There are 465 distinct stations.  
- 84 stations are ADA compliant.
- 3.69% station entrances / exits without vending allow entrance.

### Reformat data

I convert the `route8-11` from numeric to character variables as
`route1-7` so as to use `pivot_longer` to make route number and route
name distinct variables. In this step, I also drop the NA value.
Finally, I relocate columns in the dataset `transit_data_ref` as the
problem specified.

``` r
transit_data_ref = 
  mutate_at(transit_data, c("route8","route9","route10","route11"),as.character) %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    starts_with("route"),
    names_to = "route_number",
    names_prefix = "route",
    values_to = "route_name",
    values_drop_na = T
  ) %>%
  select(1:4, route_number, route_name, everything()) %>% 
  mutate(route_number = as.numeric(route_number))

dist_station_ref = distinct(transit_data_ref, line, station_name, .keep_all = T)
```

There are 60 stations serving the A train, and 17 of them are ADA
compliant.

## Problem 2

### Read and clean data

The code below imports and cleans data from the `Mr. Trash Wheel` sheet
in file `Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-7-2020-2.xlsx`. The process
begins with data import, update variable names, omit rows that do not
include dumpster-specific data, convert `year` to numberic variable,
round the number of sports balls to the nearest integer and converts the
result to an integer variable. As part of data import, I specify cell
range for reading so as to omit non-data entries.

``` r
mr_trash = readxl::read_excel(
  path = "data/Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx",
  sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel",
  range = "A2:N549"
  ) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(
    year = as.numeric(year),
    sports_balls = as.integer(round(sports_balls,0))
  )
```

The next code chunk is a similar process to read and clean the
`Professor Trash Wheel` sheet.

``` r
prof_trash = readxl::read_excel(
  path = "data/Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx",
  sheet = "Professor Trash Wheel",
  range = "A2:M96"
  ) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names()
```

### Combine datasets

I add an additional variable `trash_wheel_name` to specify which trach
wheel is which and pull the column first in each dataset. In order to
combine these two datasets, I convert the column type of `dumpster` in
`mr_trash` from character to number.

I try to plot the datasets just for fun, and I notice that there is a
mistake in one observation of `mr_trash`. The date should be
“2020-01-20” rather than “1900-01-20”. I correct it before the
combination.

``` r
mr_trash = mutate(mr_trash, trash_wheel_name = "mr.") %>% 
  select(trash_wheel_name,everything()) %>% 
  mutate(
    dumpster = as.numeric(dumpster),
    date = as.character(date)
    ) %>% 
  mutate(date = replace(date, date=="1900-01-20","2020-01-20")) %>% 
  mutate(date = as.POSIXct(date))

prof_trash = mutate(prof_trash, trash_wheel_name = "professor") %>% 
  select(trash_wheel_name,everything())
```

The following code full join the two dataset into a single tidy dataset
named `trash_wheel`.

``` r
trash_wheel = full_join(mr_trash, prof_trash)
```

    ## Joining, by = c("trash_wheel_name", "dumpster", "month", "year", "date",
    ## "weight_tons", "volume_cubic_yards", "plastic_bottles", "polystyrene",
    ## "cigarette_butts", "glass_bottles", "grocery_bags", "chip_bags",
    ## "homes_powered")

- The dataset `trash_wheel` contains 641 observations and 15 variables,
  including the name of Trash Wheel, dumpster number, date of trash
  collection, the weight and volume of the total trash, and the number
  of 8 types of trash in the associated dumpster.

- The total weight of trash collected by Professor Trash Wheel is 190.12
  tons.

- The total number of sports balls collected by Mr. Trash Wheel in 2020
  is 856.

## Problem 3

### clean dataset `pols`

I read the data in file `pols-month.csv`, update the variable name,
separate variable `mon` into integer variables `year`, `month` and
`day`, replace month number with month abbreviation and convert it to
lower case. I create a `president` variable taking values `gop` and
`dem`, and remove `prez_dem`, `prez_gop` and `day` variables.

``` r
pols = read_csv("data/fivethirtyeight_datasets/pols-month.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  separate(mon, into = c("year","month","day"),sep = "-") %>% 
  mutate(
    year = as.integer(year),
    month = as.integer(month),
    month = str_to_lower(month.abb[month]),
    day = as.integer(day),
    president = ifelse(prez_dem==1,"dem","gop")
    ) %>% 
  select(-prez_dem,-prez_gop,-day)
```

    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

### clean dataset `snp`

I read the data in file `snp.csv`, update the variable name, separate
variable `date` into integer variables `year`, `month` and `day`,
replace month number with month abbreviation and convert it to lower
case.. I then arrange the dataset according to `year` and `month` in
ascending order. Finally, I organize the dataset so that `year` and
`month` are the leading columns.

``` r
snp = read_csv("data/fivethirtyeight_datasets/snp.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  separate(date, into = c("year","month","day"),sep = "/") %>% 
  mutate(
    year = as.integer(year)+as.integer(2000),
    month = as.integer(month),
    month = str_to_lower(month.abb[month]),
    day = as.integer(day)
    ) %>% 
  arrange(year,month) %>% 
  select(year,month,day,close)
```

    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## chr (1): date
    ## dbl (1): close
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

### clean dataset `unemp`

I read the data in file `unemployment.csv` and update the variable name.
I then convert month variables from wide to long format using
`pivot_longer()`, creating two new variables: `month` taking the value
of month abbreviation in lower case (the original column names) and
`percent_of_unemp` taking the value of percent of unemployment.

``` r
unemp = read_csv("data/fivethirtyeight_datasets/unemployment.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    jan:dec,
    names_to = "month",
    values_to = "percent_of_unemp"
  )
```

    ## Rows: 68 Columns: 13
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## dbl (13): Year, Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May, Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep, Oct, Nov, Dec
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

### Join three datasets

I merging the three dataset based on `year` and `month` into a single
dataset named `result`.

``` r
snp_to_pols = left_join(pols,snp,by = c("year","month"))
result = left_join(snp_to_pols,unemp,by = c("year","month"))
```
